AC Milan are looking to reinforce the midfield department with another player. Many have been linked with a move to the San Siro, such as Bolognaâ€™s Nicolas Dominguez as well as Federico Redondo (currently plying his trade for Argentinos Juniors) who is the son of Fernando Redondo, a former Real Madrid and Milan player. 

I however think Milan should sign Redondo as he is younger and he has more room for growth.
